Key Concepts of Factory Design Pattern:

1. Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

2. Product: The interface or abstract class representing the objects that the factory method creates.

3. Concrete Product: A specific implementation of the product interface.

4. Creator: The abstract class that declares the factory method. This class may also define a default implementation of the factory method.

5. Concrete Creator: Implements the factory method to create specific concrete products.
